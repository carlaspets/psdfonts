# psdfonts.com web app
A experimental little web app that allows people to upload psd files and get back  list of the fonts used. Uses the excellent [psd.rb](http://cosmos.layervault.com/psdrb.html) gem from the guys at [Layervault](https://layervault.com/)

## Install app
To get this bad boy installed on locally just download the zip and run `bundle install --path vendor/bundle` this will setup the app.

## How to build & run
The app now uses [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com/) to build run jobs on assets files to install dependencies run `npm install`.
To start a local server and compile sass etc run `gulp` from the terminal to build the files out and watch them for any changes.

I use [Pow](http://pow.cx/) for all my local projects which gives you a nice dev url to go to `http://psdfonts.dev`. If your not keen on the command line, I would strongly recommend [Anvil for Mac](http://anvilformac.com/) free.

## Questions and Pull Requests
I'm always keen to learn and if anyone finds anything that would make it better then feel free to drop an issue or a pull request.
