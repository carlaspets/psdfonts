# psdfonts.com web app
A experimental little web app that allows people to upload psd files and get back  list of the fonts used. Uses the excellent [psd.rb](http://cosmos.layervault.com/psdrb.html) gem from the guys at [Layervault](https://layervault.com/)

## Install app
To get this bad boy installed on locally just download the zip and run `bundle install --path vendor/bundle` this will setup the app.

## How to build & run
The app uses Grunt to build run jobs on assets files to install dependencies run `npm install`. 
To start a local server and compile sass etc run `grunt` from the terminal and head to `127.0.0.1:9393` in your browser.
